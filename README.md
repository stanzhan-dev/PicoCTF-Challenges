# picoCTF Challenges: Learning and Sharing Knowledge

Welcome to my repository where I document my journey through the **picoCTF** challenges! This repository is a place to learn, experiment, and share knowledge related to various cybersecurity and Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges.

## About picoCTF

[picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) is an annual, beginner-friendly Capture the Flag competition hosted by Carnegie Mellon University. It’s designed to teach cybersecurity concepts through hands-on challenges. The challenges cover a wide range of topics, including cryptography, web security, reverse engineering, forensics, binary exploitation, and more.

## My Goal

The goal of this repository is to:

- **Learn**: Through solving various picoCTF challenges, I am gaining practical knowledge and experience in the field of cybersecurity.
- **Document**: I will document the solutions, explain the vulnerabilities, techniques, and tools used, as well as provide insights into how I approach solving the challenges.
- **Share**: My goal is to contribute to the cybersecurity community by sharing my knowledge and solutions to help others who are also learning.

## Structure

This repository is organized into different folders based on the types of challenges:

- `web_security/` – Challenges related to web security such as SQL injection, XSS, authentication flaws, etc.
- `cryptography/` – Cryptography-related challenges, including classical ciphers, modern encryption, hashing, etc.
- `reverse_engineering/` – Challenges requiring reverse engineering skills, such as disassembling and analyzing binaries.
- `forensics/` – Forensics-related challenges, where you'll find clues hidden in files or through analyzing digital evidence.
- `binary_exploitation/` – Exploiting vulnerabilities in compiled binaries (e.g., buffer overflows).
- `misc/` – Miscellaneous challenges that don't fit neatly into the other categories.

Each folder will contain a set of challenges, and inside, you will find a detailed description of the challenge, my approach, and the solution.

## How I Solve the Challenges

For each challenge, I follow a structured approach:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Carefully read the description and instructions. Sometimes challenges come with hints or background context that can be important.
2. **Analyze the Target**: I review the provided files (e.g., source code, binaries, websites, etc.), looking for security flaws or vulnerabilities.
3. **Use Tools**: I make use of various tools and techniques such as `Burp Suite`, `Ghidra`, `IDA Pro`, `Wireshark`, `Nmap`, `Hashcat`, `CyberChef`, and more.
4. **Experiment and Test**: After identifying potential vulnerabilities, I test them to see how I can exploit them to extract the flag or gain unauthorized access.
5. **Document**: Once a challenge is solved, I document my steps, including any interesting techniques, vulnerabilities discovered, and solutions implemented.
6. **Learn and Improve**: Even if I get stuck or fail, I learn from each step. I revisit my solutions to improve my skills and share any insights with the community.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is mainly for **learning and reference**. You can explore my solutions, read through the explanations, and try out the challenges yourself.
