# Web Exploitation Challenges

This section of the repository contains my solutions and notes for **Web Exploitation** challenges in picoCTF. Web exploitation challenges typically focus on discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. These vulnerabilities could include issues like **SQL injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **Authentication flaws**, **Server Misconfigurations**, and more.

## About Web Exploitation

Web exploitation challenges in CTFs simulate real-world security vulnerabilities that exist in web applications. Understanding and exploiting these vulnerabilities is essential for becoming proficient in the field of cybersecurity.

### Common Topics Covered:
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Exploiting unsanitized user inputs in database queries.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages that execute in a user's browser.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Making an authenticated user perform an unintended action on a web application.
- **Authentication Bypass**: Bypassing login forms, session management, or exploiting poor authentication mechanisms.
- **Command Injection**: Injecting commands into the server to execute arbitrary commands.
- **File Inclusion Vulnerabilities**: Exploiting improper file handling to include files that shouldn't be accessible.
- **Security Misconfigurations**: Discovering and exploiting incorrect server settings or weak permissions.

## How I Approach Web Exploitation Challenges

1. **Identify the Web Application's Functionality**: Understand the application's purpose, its endpoints, and how users interact with it.
2. **Look for Input Fields and User Inputs**: Inputs such as search fields, login forms, and URL parameters are common places for vulnerabilities to hide.
3. **Test for Common Web Vulnerabilities**: Use techniques like SQLi, XSS, or command injection to test for common vulnerabilities.
4. **Analyze Responses and Errors**: Web applications often return error messages or behave differently when vulnerable. I carefully analyze any responses or errors to gather more information.
5. **Use Tools**: I rely on tools like **Burp Suite**, **OWASP ZAP**, and **Nikto** to intercept requests, modify inputs, and scan for weaknesses.
6. **Document the Exploitation Process**: Once a vulnerability is identified, I document how to exploit it and the steps required to retrieve the flag.
