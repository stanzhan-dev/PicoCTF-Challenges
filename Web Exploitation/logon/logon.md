## Solution
Cookies are small pieces of data that a website stores in your browser. They can hold information like your session data, preferences, or authentication tokens. When you visit a site, the browser sends cookies associated with that site back to the server, and the server can use that data to tailor your experience.

By just typing in a random user and a random password, it works but we get nothing. However, if we use the inspect element and modify the value in the cookie 'admin' and set it to True, when we refresh the page we will see the flag.
