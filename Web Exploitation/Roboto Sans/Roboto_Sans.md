Challenge Description: The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.
```
## Solution
Similar to another PicoCTF we did called "Where are the Robots?" but with extra steps. We need to use access the secret/hidden directory using 'robots.txt'. Quick reminder, robots.txt is a simple text file placed in a website's root directory that provides directives web crawlers about which parts of the site they are allowed or not allowed to crawl and index.

The front page, you can try using inspect element but you won't find anything useful.

Looking at the robots.txt file

Using a decoder on the 3 ciphertext, first and third ciphertext outputs gibberish, while the second ciphertext, if you remove the ==, you get a new directory.

Using the new directory to find the flag
```
