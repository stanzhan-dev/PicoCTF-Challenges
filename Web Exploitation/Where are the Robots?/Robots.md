Challenge Description: Can you find the robots?
```

## Solution
To solve this, we need to know what robots are: robots.txt is a simple text file placed in a website's root directory that provides instructions (directives) to web robots (crawlers) about which parts of the site they are allowed or not allowed to crawl and index, helping manage server load and control search engine access to certain pages, though it's a voluntary protocol not foolproof for preventing indexing.

The front page has nothing we need and even using inspect element we really can't find anything hidden.

By taking robots.txt in the url we get to see the directories that are not indexed.

We type the hidden directory in the url to get the flag.

After adding the header, the server treats you like a “developer” and grants you access. The response now contains the flag.
