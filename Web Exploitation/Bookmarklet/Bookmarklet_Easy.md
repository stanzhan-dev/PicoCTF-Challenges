Challenge Description: Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?
```

## Solution
This challenge is mainly about bookmarklets. A bookmarklet is a browser bookmark that runs JavaScript code on the current webpage when clicked, instead of navigating to a new URL, adding features like text highlighting, data extraction, or style changes to enhance functionality and automate tasks directly on the page. It works by storing a special javascript: URL in the bookmark, which tells the browser to execute the embedded code snippet on the page you're currently viewing. 

Essentially, when you replace the URL with the javascript code, it runs the code when you click on the bookmark.
