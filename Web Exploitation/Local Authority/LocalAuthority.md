## Solution

Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters (such as whitespace, comments, and line breaks) from the code without affecting its functionality.
- Faster Loading Times: By eliminating non-essential parts to reduce file size, it is quicker to load, improving performance.
- Bandwidth Efficiency: Reduced file sizes use less bandwidth, useful in mobile environments or for users with slower internet connections.
- Obfuscation: Although minification is not intended as a security measure, it can make it slightly harder for someone to understand the code by looking at it, since it removes readable comments and formatting.

There's many ways you can find the flag:
- CTRL+U / ⌘+U in your browser to view the page source
- 'view-source:' before the URL
- curl <URL> in your shell.

Use line wrap to make everything more compact and as you can see, the flag is there.
